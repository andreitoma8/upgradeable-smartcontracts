This is a simple Smart Contract made with Solidity, Brownie and OpneZeppelin code.

The SC Box can store and retrieve a value that is initalized to 0.
The SC BoxV2 adds a function to increment the value.

This was made following the freeCodeCamp Solidity with Python Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ
